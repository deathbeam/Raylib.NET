Generates bindings, builds natives for whatever os you are on etc:

```sh
dotnet build
```

Im not touching the generated stuff, only generator.

### TODO/Maybe

- [ ] Normalize ints/uints
- [ ] Any way to map enums to input params automatically?
- [ ] Detect arrays automatically, use Span?
- [ ] String/NativeBool in delegates?
- [ ] Bindgen order
